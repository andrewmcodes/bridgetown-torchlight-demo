## [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com/)

You can learn more about how to build and deploy your new website by reading the  [Bridgetown documentation](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs).

You can choose a [theme](https://github.com/topics/bridgetown-theme) or add some [plugins](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/plugins/) to get started quickly.

Be sure to check out the [Bridgetown Cards](https://bridgetown.cards) community site for helpful tips & tricks.

If you run into any issues or have additional questions, please join us in our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4) or in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/discussions).

_Have fun and **good luck**!_

## [Torchlight](https://torchlight.dev)

Can be run as a hook on every build, but this can occasionally put you into a weird state where you have to reload to see the changes.

```ruby
class Builders::Torchlight < SiteBuilder
  def build
    hook :site, :post_write, priority: :high do
      system "yarn torchlight"
    end
  end
end
```

There really isn't a need to run Torchlight everytime we rebuild the site though...

We can just run it at the end of our build process via the CLI or with a hook. Or we could only run it when BRIDGETOWN_ENV is set to `production`.

```ruby
class Builders::Torchlight < SiteBuilder
  def build
    hook :site, :post_write, priority: :high do
      next unless Bridgetown.env.production?

      system "yarn torchlight"
    end
  end
end
```
